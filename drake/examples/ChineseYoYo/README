*Parameterestimation files are in:

SimplePulley


* Mirror Law Closed Form Formulation:

SoftPaddle_v4.nb: For the real system, check if it is the same as SoftPaddle_v3.nb, which is only on the experiment computer.
SoftPaddle_v5_simulation.nb: simulation version with different axes


*Gain Calculation:
poincareLinearMirrorLawControlReal_v1.m: Calculates the Poincare Gains based on the desire juggling height and x position and velocity and it uses SoftPaddleReal_v1.urdf.


*Control files are in ChineseYoYo

ChineseYoYo.m: test the URDF in passive mode with no paddle joint. it uses ChineseYoYO_v2.urdf

ChineseYoYo_v2.urdf: contains the experimental parameters and is also used for the actual simulation

SoftPaddleHybridReal.m: Just the plant with paddle joint, it is used by SoftPaddleControlReal_v2.m

SoftPaddleReal_v1.urdf: almost the same as ChineseYoYo_v2.urdf, but also contains the paddle joint definition

SoftPaddleControlReal_v2.m: Most up-to-date mirror law closed-loop control simulation. Needs the gains placed in here.
